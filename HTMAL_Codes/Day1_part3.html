            An embedded system is a small computer that forms part of a larger system, <br>
          device or machine. Its purpose is to control the device and to allow a user to interact with it.<br>

            Steps in the Embedded System Design Process
        </h3>

        The different steps in the embedded system design flow/flow diagram include the following.
        <h3 style="color: black;">
        Abstraction
        </h3>
        In this stage the problem related to the system is abstracted.
        <h3 style="color: black;">
            Hardware and Software Architecture
        </h3>
       
        Proper knowledge of hardware and software to be known before starting any design process.
        <h3 style="color: black;">
            Extra Functional Properties
        </h3>
        Extra functions to be implemented are to be understood completely from the main design.
        <h3 style="color: black;">
            System Related Family of Design
        </h3>
        When designing a system, one should refer to a previous system-related family of design.
        <h3 style="color: black;">
            Modular Design 
        </h3>
        Separate module designs must be made so that they can be used later on when required.
        <h3 style="color: black;">
            Mapping

            Mapping
        </h3>
        
        Based on software mapping is done. For example, data flow and program flow are mapped into one.
